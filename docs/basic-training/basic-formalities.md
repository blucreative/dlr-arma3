# Basic formalities
As a strict MILSIM unit we believe that there is value to the meta game that MILSIM provides, however we also understand and acknowledge our role as a gaming community where people come to relax.

As such we have a system of formalities, which must be obeyed, as they are designed to maintain mutual respect and courtesy without imposing unnecessary restraints on casual recreation.

Formalities in game are taken very seriously in this group and as such it is important that you understand the items detailed in this training and obey them in the appropriate environments.

## Teamspeak and courtesies
### Joining a Room
When joining a TeamSpeak channel you must announce that you have joined this channel. When joining the channel, you should state your name and, if so desired, your rank.

When a member joins a channel and identifies themselves, no further action is required for most members. The only exception to this rule is when Officers (2Lt and above) join official Operation channels.

If an officer joins an official operation channel any member of the channel should call the room to attention by saying, "Room, attention!" At this point all conversations should stop until the Officer proclaims, "At ease." Failure to respect a call to attention could lead to disciplinary action.

### Use of Rank
We do not require that you refer to someone by their rank in our channels, however, it is common courtesy to call officers "Sir," unless the officer in question says otherwise.

### Name Format
Names should be formatted correctly at all times. In teamspeak and Discord, your rank will be added automatically, however you will need to format it in-game. The proper format is, Rank., (First Initial.) Last Name/Gamertag. We do have some restrictions on gamertags that are explained in our rules and regulations on our community forums.

Example name formats:
- Sgt. B. Smith
- Kgn. Bamboozle

## Room Access and Usage
In TeamSpeak we have a number of rooms to cater to the various elements that make up our Unit.

Please do not idle in rooms that are focused on Operations of Unit activity, as they are for focused discussion and conversation regarding the units activities. They should not be used for general gaming or conversation, we have other channels for this, and misuse is a disciplinary offence.

You should not enter another elementâ€™s channel without a member of that element present and without notifying someone in the channel first.

## In Game Formalities
### Uniform and Dress
Uniforms are managed through the Virtual Loadout Editor/Arsenal.

Combat Uniforms will be issued by the command structure at the beginning of the operation, but are strictly based on British military uniforms.

>> **Warning**: LANCS start and end all operations in a Barracks, either our home base, or Forward Operating Bases whilst on deployment. Primary weapons and equipment should not be carried on-base unless being briefed for deployment. Unauthorised carrying of weapons or equipment will result in disciplinary action.

### Rank Use
Ranks should only be used on base and never in a deployment environment.

### Negligent Discharges
Accidental or unauthorised discharge of a weapon on base is cause for disciplinary action and may result in suspension of firearm privileges depending on the severity of the occurence.

### Fratricide
Fratricide is forbidden on any LANCS asset at any time under any circumstance. Fratricide will be met with automatic disciplinary action and any punishment will be decided by the Unit Commander in line with the disciplinary guidelines.

>> **Danger**: We do not play soft ball when it comes to fratricide of any kind. It completely undermines our environment. This includes mercy killing and euthanasia. Fratricide is one of the fastest way out of this unit.
