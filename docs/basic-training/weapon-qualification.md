# Weapon Qualifications and Testing
In LANCS, weapons qualification takes place on ranges designed for the weapon in question. Qualification involves hitting a certain number of targets, sometimes with a particular accuracy, within a given time window.

Upon completing a qualification, which must take place in the presence of an officer, the weapon you qualified on will be available to you on deployed operations. Leadership will keep a very close eye on weapons being used on operations. Anyone attempting to use a weapon they are not cleared for will be met with disciplinary action.

Basic training will involve the completion of qualifications for the L85A2 Infantry Weapon, the L131A1 General Service Pistol and the various types of grenade in use by LANCS (Smoke, HE and Stun/Flash).

This will qualify a soldier to use the basic weapon equipment required for any role in the unit.

> **Note**: Upon completing any qualification attempt, all weapons should be 'made safe' by removing the magazine and engaging the safety catch. Attempt to fire once down range to ensure the barrell is empty and then declare, "Weapon Safe, <rank of training officer>" to communicate that the weapon is clear.

> **Warning**: You are only permitted to take 2 attempts on each range during a BCT session. Failure to qualify on the ranges will result in failing the training session and you will be required to retake it.

## Rifle Qualification
To qualify with the L85, you will fire 60 rounds (2 magazines), one round per target, from a variety of stances.

No sights will be used other than iron sights. Targets will appear at ranges between 25 and 300 metres.

If you miss a target, you should not attempt to discharge a second round onto the target. Attempting to do so will lead to disqualification.

Scoring will be judged on the following thresholds:
- 45/60 - Qualified
- 50/60 - Marksman
- 58/60 - Expert Marksman

> **Note**: Only those that achieve Marksman or above will be able to proceed onto Designated Marksman Rifle and Sniper Rifle courses. Anyone wishing to pursue these courses can request a re-assessment which will be processed by the command structure.

## Pistol Qualification
To qualify with the L131A1 Pistol, you must engage 30 targets with one round per target. Your score will be judged on the following thresholds:
- 20/30 - Qualified
- 25/30 - Marksman Pistoleer
- 30/30 - Expert Pistoleer

## Hand Grenade Qualification
5 Grenades will be thrown on the grenade range. You will be judged on two criteria:
- Safety of Use
- Accuracy

To qualify, you must hit three target with three of the grenades, avoiding any safety violations.

When throwing grenades, safety and communication are paramount. You should observe the situation around you and ensure that all friendly personnel are out of the blast radius. You should then clearly yell your intention and target, such as, "Grenade Out! Bunker, 2 O'Clock." Only one this announcement is made should you begin to throw the grenade.

When handling grenades, always try to keep a non-lethal grenade selected in your equipment unless you are ready to throw a lethal grenade. This prevents accidental grenade discharges.

> **Danger**: Any serious safety violations on the grenade range will lead to immediate course failure and will require the recruit to repeat the entire training programme.
