# Weapon Familiarisation

LANCS uses a diverse array of weapons equipment in order to accomplish its objectives. It is important that you are able to correctly identify and handle these weapons so that you may effectively communicate and work with other members of the group.

## The Importance of Weapon Safety
The safe handling of weapons is incredibly important in LANCS because of the depth of our simulation. Friendly Fire incidents are treated the same as legitimate casualties and will cause the same level of tactical problems.

Friendly Fire will always result in disciplinary action automatically and in all cases. This may result in negative action up to and including a discharge with disgrace.

All weapons in the LANCS environment are fitted with Safety switches. These are activated by pressing ``Shift + ( the button directly left of the 1 key - varies by national keyboard )``. You can check your control settings if you struggle to find the key. This safety catch will prevent accidental discharges and other problematic events.

## The Rules of Weapon Safety
1. Do not point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill. The weapon should remain in the rest position when not in use.
2. In safe areas where security is maintained, magazines should be removed from the weapon system and on supporting weapons the safety engaged.
3. Do not discharge your weapon for any reason other than combat engagement ( Celebration Shots and Direction Indicating Shots waste ammo and risk lives ).

## Ammunition and Equipment
To maintain a level of realism in our simulation, we will avoid using Arsenals where possible. Loadouts will be provide at the beginning of an Operation and extra supplies will be provided on the whim of the commanding officers.

We try to treat ammunition and equipment levels extremely seriously in our group and a lot of our gameplay revolves around logistics, resupply and conservation. This is all balanced by both the weight and stamina systems and our persistence systems.

Our standard issue is 9 magazines to an individual which will be issued as part of the initial loadout.

## LANCS Weapon List
LANCS offer different weapons for different roles. Every weapon has certain qualification requirements, which are included later in our training documentation. We aim to provide more training courses eventually, to allow you to unlock more weapon proficiencies.

High Command, Platoon Leaders and Section Commanders should always be consulted to ensure you have a weapon system that benefits the team. Customisations to a loadout at the start of an Op will always be double checked prior to deployment.

### Pistols
Only one pistol is cleared for use in LANCS:

**L131A1 â€“ Glock 17 General Service Pistol**\\
The Glock 17 Gen 4 pistol is much lighter than its predecessor, Browning pistol, and more accurate. It also has an increased magazine capacity of 17 x 9mm rounds, compared to 13 rounds for the Browning.

### Assault Rifles

**L85A2 SA80IW Assault Rifle**\\
SA80 is the designation for a revolutionary family of assault weapons. On its introduction, it proved so accurate that the Army marksmanship tests had to be redesigned.

These are the British Army's standard combat weapons. Made by Heckler and Koch, they fire NATO standard 5.56 x 45mm ammunition.

A major mid-life update in 2002 resulted in the SA80A2 series - the most reliable weapons of their type in the world. This reliability is combined with accuracy, versatility and ergonomic design. It is considered a first-class weapon system and world leader in small arms.

**L86A2 Light Support Weapons (LSW)**\\
SA80 A2 light support weapon (LSW) has a heavier and longer barrel than the SA80 individual weapon allowing greater muzzle velocity and accuracy.

When fired from the integrated bipod and using the standard SUSAT sight, the LSW is accurate and consistent. It can fire 610 to 775 rounds per minute out to a range of 1000metres.

Recently, the LSW has been redesigned to operate as a Sharpshooter rifle, but is not the preferred Sharpshooter rifle for LANCS.

### Grenade Launchers

**L123A2 Underslung Grenade Launcher (UGL)**\\
The L123A2 (also known as AG36) is the standard issue grenade launcher for the L85A2 rifle in the British Army.

The AG36 is a single-shot 40 mm grenade launcher that operates on the High-Low System and was designed primarily for installation on the G36 assault rifle, designed by the German weapons manufacturing company Heckler & Koch. It is the standard grenade launcher for the British Army, for use on the L85A2 rifle. In British use it is designated L123. The L123 is the standard grenade launcher for the British Army since 2002.

The UGL allows fire teams to deliver effective fragmenting munitions out to 350 metres. Advantages of the system are low recoil, ease of use, reduced ammunition weight and ability to have a chambered grenade at the ready whilst continuing to fire the SA80.

### Designated Marksman/Sharpshooter Rifles

**L86A2 LSW Sharpshooter Variant**\\
One of the DMR options within LANCS is the L86A3 LSW. The differences between the Assault version (L86A2) and DMR (L86A3) version of this weapon are mostly cosmetic, with the only mechanical change being the removal of fully automatic fire mode. Cosmetically, the L86A3 has the barrel guard removed and the collapsible bipod situated at the front of the handguard, as opposed to at the end of the barrel (as seen on the L86A2).

**L129A1 Sharpshooter Rifle**\\
The sharpshooter rifle has improved the long-range firepower available on the front line. The rifle fires a 7.62mm round and has enhanced accuracy of engagement during longer-range firefights. This weapon is used by some of the best shots in the infantry. This weapon uses a 20 Round detachable box magazine.

### Light Machine Guns
**L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)**\\
The L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) is a 7.62 x 51mm belt-fed general purpose machine gun which can be used as a light weapon and in a sustained fire (SF) role.

In the SF role, mounted on a tripod and fitted with the C2 optical sight, it is fired by a two-man team who are grouped in a specialist Machine Gun Platoon to provide battalion-level fire support. In SF mode, the GPMG, with a two-man crew, lays down 750 rounds-per-minute at ranges up to 1800 metres.

The GPMG can be carried by foot soldiers and employed as a light machine gun (LMG), although it has largely been replaced by the lighter 5.56 x 45mm Minimi in this role, in most regiments. A fold-out bipod is used to support the GPMG in the LMG role.

Versions of the GPMG are mounted on most Army vehicles and some helicopters.

**L110 Minimi Para LMG**\\
Developed from the Minimi Light Machine Gun following experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, the LMG is a belt-fed suppression weapon. It provides the section commander with the capability to impose sustained suppressive fire on to an objective out to 300m and increases the overall firepower available to the section commander.

The LMG complements the Light Support Weapon and enhances the effectiveness of all section weapons across the spectrum of infantry operations.

### Heavy Machine Guns
**L111A1 HMG**\\
The L111A1 HMG is a .50 (12.7mm) caliber heavy machine gun. The HMG is a modernised version of the American-made Browning M2, which served with distinction during World War 2. The belt-fed HMG fires at a rate of 485-635 rounds-per-minute to a range up to 2000 meters. HMGs are mounted on tripods and they can also be mounted to WMIK Land Rovers. The stopping power of the HMG's 12.7mm rounds is excellent and can take on light armour and soft skinned vehicles.

**L134A1 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG)**\\
The Heckler & Koch 40mm Grenade Machine Gun (GMG) provides unrivalled infantry suppression combining the best characteristics of the heavy machine guns or light mortars usually employed in this role.

Conventional rifle ammunition provides no fragmentation effect and is largely not effective enough against advancing armoured infantry fighting vehicles and battle tanks. On the other hand, mortars have the disadvantage of a relatively low rate of fire.

The GMG combines the advantages of both of these two types of weapons delivering high flexibility and firepower combined with the fragmentation effect of mortar ammunition.

The GMG is usually mounted on WMIK (weapons mount installation kit) Land Rovers but can also be used from ground-based tripods.

### Shotguns
**L128A1 Combat Shotgun**\\
The Combat Shotgun is a semi-automatic, tubular magazine-fed weapon cambered for the 12 gauge cartridge.

The operating system is the ARGO (Auto-Regulating Gas Operated) Twin (two gas pistons) System with a rotating bolt head and dual locking lugs. It is fitted with an EOT tech sight for use day or night and a fixed iron sight. It has a telescopic buttstock. It can be fired from the conventional fire positions, except the squatting position.

### Sub Machine Guns
> **Note**: Sub Machine Guns are very rarely used by LANCS, however we actively train with them and they are a common choice for our kill-house timed clearance competitions.

**Heckler & Koch MP5**\\
The MP5 is a compact sub machine gun in use since the late 70s. The MP5A3 (L91A1) variant, with a collapsible stock is ideal for close quarters combat..

The 9x19mm Parabellum round fired by the MP5 was preferred in hostage rescue scenarios as it was deemed less likely to pass through the target (or walls) and strike a hostage. The prevalance of body armour, however, means that modern-day counter terrorist (CT) teams may elect to instead employ a short-barrelled carbine chambered in 5.56 x 45mm NATO.

A further variant of the weapon, the MP5SD, with an integrated suppressor, is used for dealing with sentries or any other threat that needs to be neutralised quietly. When used with sub-sonic ammunition, the MP5SD is extremely quiet.

### Sniper Rifles
**L118A1/L96A1 Accuracy International AWC Long Range Rifle**\\
AI developed a version of the L96 for the Swedish military who needed a sniper rifle that could operate in the extreme cold. Improvements in the resulting AW rifle include the use of polymer materials in the stock, handguards and other areas instead of the less durable and more fragile resin used in the L96. The bolt was altered to prevent it icing up and the safety was changed to a three-position design. The trigger guard was enlarged to allow for the use of thick gloves. Likewise, the 10-round magazine was given tabs to make them easier to handle with gloved hands. The British would subsequently adopt the AW as the L118A1.

**L115A3 Accuracy International AWSM Long Range Rifle**\\
British snipers fulfil a vital and enduring role on the battlefield, in terms of intelligence-gathering, target identification and eliminating high-value targets.

The L115A3 rifle, part of the Sniper System Improvement Programme (SSIP), is a large-calibre weapon which provides state-of-the-art telescopic day and night, all-weather sights, increasing a sniper's effective range considerably.

The first batch of SSIPs were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2008.

Designed to achieve a first-round hit at 600 metres and harassing fire out to 1,100 metres, Accuracy International's L96 sniper rifle has also been upgraded with a new x3-x12 x 50 sight and spotting scope.

Manufactured by Accuracy International, the L115A3 long range rifle fires an 8.59mm (.338 Lapua Magnum) bullet which is heavier than the 7.62mm round of the L96/L118A1 and less likely to be deflected over extremely long ranges.

**L135A1 Barrett M82A1 - Anti Material Sniper Rifle**\\
The Barrett M82 is a semi-automatic anti-material rifle created by the American company Barrett Firearms Manufacturing in 1980 and entering in operation in 1989.

The L135A1 is used as an anti-materiel weapon and EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) tool. The long effective range along with high energy ammunition allows for effective operations against targets like radar cabins, trucks, parked aircrafts and soon. It also can be used to defeat enemy snipers or criminals from stand off range or when targets are behind the cover, but the anti-personnel work is not a major application for this weapon.

In order to use this weapon within LANCS, a solider must have achieved the highest grade possible in marksman training and show the right level of judgement and character when performing sniper/long range objectives. This weapon is rarely deployed by LANCS due to its destructive nature and the high possibility of player abuse.

### Launchers/Guided Weapons

**ILAW CS HEDP/HP**\\
The L2A1 ILAW is a 84mm unguided anti-armour rocket launcher that is designed to be carried by a single soldier. The one-shot ILAW's launcher tube is disposed of after the rocket has been fired. The ILAW has an effective range of 300 meters and minimum range of 10. When fired, the ILAW creates significant 'back blast' and operators are trained to ensure that there are no obstructions (including friendly forces) behind them in a 90 degree cone out to 100 meters before they launch.

UK forces use the CS variant of the weapon which is optimised for urban warfare and has less of a back blast. In theory the CS should be firable from within buildings. The CS fires a projectile which can penetrate 500-600mm of armour, allowing it to knock out/disable light armour such as APCs and soft-skinned vehicles such as trucks. The ILAW is unlikely to be effective against modern Main Battle Tanks (MBTs). ILAWs are also quite effective against bunkers, fox holes and buildings. When assaulting a building, ILAWs will often be used to punch entry holes through the walls.

ILAWs are water-proof and unlike the M72 LAW system, they do not need to be extended before firing.

'ILAW' stands for Interim Light Anti-armour Weapon and is meant to fill the gap between the LAW 80 launcher and the upcoming NLAW which will be a guided missile system.

**NLAW**\\
The Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW) is the first, non-expert, short-range, anti-tank missile that rapidly knocks out any main battle tank in just one shot by striking it from above.

NLAW utilises predicted line of sight guidance and has overfly top and direct attack modes, and it is easy to use, making it a valuable tank destroyer for light forces that operate dismounted in all environments, including built up areas.

It also has night vision capability and is designed for all climate conditions and environments.

**Javelin**\\
Javelin, the medium range anti-tank guided weapon replacement for Milan, is an enhanced version of the American weapon proven on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by US forces.

Although designed primarily to destroy tanks and light armoured vehicles, Javelin will also provide a potent, all-weather, day or night capability against fixed defences, such as bunkers and buildings.

The integrated sight allows the operator to acquire the target, lock-on, fire and 'forget'. This means that as soon as the missile is launched, the firer can acquire another target or move position. Javelin has a maximum range of 2500m, and overfly and direct attack modes of operation.

Javelin is a crew-served weapon operated by a firer and a controller/observer. The controller/observer commands the weapon and assists with loading, identifying targets and battlefield damage assessment.
