# Basic formalities
As a strict MILSIM unit we believe that there is value to the meta game that MILSIM provides, however we also understand and acknowledge our role as a gaming community where people come to relax.

As such we have a system of formalities, which must be obeyed, as they are designed to maintain mutual respect and courtesy without imposing unnecessary restraints on casual recreation.

Formalities in game are taken very seriously in this group and as such it is important that you understand the items detailed in this training and obey them in the appropriate environments.

## Teamspeak and courtesies
### Joining a Room
When joining a teamspeak channel you must announce that you have joined this channel. When joining the channel, you should state your name and, if so desired, your rank.

When a member joins a channel and identifies themselves, no further action is required for most members. The only exception to this rule is when Officers (2Lt and above) join official Operation channels.

If an officer joins an official operation channel any member of the channel should call the room to attention by saying, "Room, attention!" At this point all conversations should stop until the Officer proclaims, "At ease." Failure to respect a call to attention could lead to disciplinary action.

### Use of Rank
We do not require that you refer to someone by their rank in our channels, however, it is common courtesy to call officers "Sir," unless the officer in question says otherwise.

### Name Format
Names should be formatted correctly at all times. In teamspeak and Discord, your rank will be added automatically, however you will need to format it in-game. The proper format is, Rank., (First Initial.) Last Name/Gamertag. We do have some restrictions on gamertags that are explained in our rules and regulations on our community forums.

Example name formats:
- Sgt. B. Smith
- Kgn. Bamboozle
