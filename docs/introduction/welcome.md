# An Introduction to the Duke of Lancaster Regiment

## Foreword by the Unit Commander
The Duke of Lancaster Regiment formed as a result of a recognition that there was a need for some sort of British military simulation unit, providing a fun, safe space for all. After many a hour spent on 'Public Zeus' within Arma 3, a group of like-minded individuals came together with an idea to form a respectful, committed community of players.

Many seem to argue that true MILSIM can take the fun out of Arma, but we strongly disagree. We believe that properly executed MILSIM can provide a deep sense of pride and satisfaction that far outweighs that of the simple 'run and gun' methodology employed by many. Observing the multiple strands of activity being performed to achieve a common objective is what I see as an ultimate achievement for any online game. Regardless of this, the staff at LANCS strive to find the perfect balance between the necessary levels of training and discipline to successfully execute a mission, whilst avoiding the feeling of being too strict or overbearing.

It leaves me to say, thank you, for reading our documentation and considering our unit. The way we play demands a level of respect and discipline that is not for everyone, however those that do choose to join us, do so with a great sense of pride and community.

## What is MILSIM?
MILSIM, or Military Simulation, forms the backbone of the Duke of Lancaster Regiment. We operate primarily as a Tactical Simulation group, and by this we mean that we aim to fully simulate in game tactics as they would be carried out by real world military forces, from leadership levels right down to the standard Kingsman (see our ranks for an explanation of what a Kingsman is). We do not, however, believe that this needs to result in increased complexity for our players, and we may make allowances and sacrifices to provide a better experience and increase player cohesion.

Below are several key facets of our definition for MILSIM, that will help you to evaluate our playstyle.

**Third and First Person camera - For all players.**

We do this for a number of reasons. Primarily because research from over thousands of hours in game has found that 1st person mode consistently causes eye strain, motion sickness and fatigue in players over long periods of time. It is unfortunate that as a result of this we lose some tactical relationships however we encourage players to maintain self moderating in their use of third person and we generally discourage the use of tactics that cheapen the overal simulation by abusing third person mechanics ( i.e "wall peeking" ).

**Advanced ACE Medical Simulation**

A corner stone of our gameplay is the use of an extermely comprehensive medical simulation. We appreciate the depth of simulation that this adds to the game and the way it allows us to establish multiple levels of casualty care in game. We also believe that any specialist role such as medics should be comprehensively trained in their area and this allows us to give our medics a complex and detailed challenge in game.

**Realistic Logistics and Equipment**

We believe in using standardized and realistic equipment that simulates the load a conventional British soldier would carry into combat. We believe in simulation over gameplay and will sacrifice gameplay advantages such as a stronger helmet or larger backpack for the realistic equivalent that would be afforded in combat. One good example of this is thermal sights which we heavily restrict to only the roles that would posses such optics on the real battle field.

**Limited Respawns**

Even though some Arma units dictate that no respawns will be available - we have chosen to allow a limited use of respawns. As we are heavily focused on MILSIM, it should not come as a surprise that a downed player should, ideally, remain down for the rest of the mission, but we also realise that this could take away from the enjoyment of the game. As such, we will choose how many respawns are available on a mission-by-mission basis. Allowances will always be made where character death occurs due to a glitch or admin issue.

**Infantry Focused Combined Arms**

We limit the number of vehicular assets - in particular heavy ground armour - so that we can create a great experience for the infantry.

**Quality over Quantity**

We focus on recruiting great people to fight with us and training them to the highest level. Many Arma units focus on getting people in the door regardless of their attitude or alignment with the group. We are interested in people who are going to stick around and learn the tactics and techniques that we use.

**Real Life Comes First**

We understand that Arma is just a game and as such you might not always be able to attend. We never want you to be in a position where you are sacrifing your real life activities to meet our requirements and we implement strong redundancy plans at every level of the chain of command so that absence does not affect the wider group.

However we also encourage you to think about the good of the unit when you need to be absent and consider stepping down from your position to take a Leave of Absence in the event that life takes an unforseen turn.
