Qualification Programs
=========================

Training in the 1st RRF is split into Qualifications which are awarded upon completion of the requisite training goals.

Below you will find a list of each qualification the unit offers. 
Within each qualification the criteria are established alongside the provided access or equipment that the course unlocks upon completion.

Qualification Process
----------------------

To achieve a training goal you must be qualified as complete and compliant with published standard of the goal by a member who has already completed the goal.

To certify a member on a goal it is not necessary that the certifying member has completed all aspects of the qualification to which the goal belongs.

Once the qualifying member believes the goal has been reasonably established he should submit a summary Training Completion Form (TCF) which will notify S1 of the accreditation of the trained individual.

Training goals **must be witnessed** and cannot be taken on candidate's implied or stated merrit.

Training goals must be completed in an official training environment and cannot be awarded for actions taken during operations.

Training goals can however be awarded outside of official Unit Training Excercises.

S1 will process the training goal and upon program completion grant the award of any completed programs to the awarded member.
