# Ranks and Promotions
The Duke of Lancaster Regiment operates on a system of ranks which are directly tied to the position that the member holds and their seniority within the group. They can be broadly viewed as a representation of time spent in the group and whilst we expect these ranks to be recognised with respect to decisions in the unit both in and out of combat, they do not confer any form of direct seniority in other contexts such as other games or in general conversation.

This runs contrary to some other units courtesies policies that require officers be addressed accordingly at all times which is **NOT** the case in LANCS. Rank should be a measure of time spent in the unit, contribution to the unit, and the level in the chain of command in reference to the formal activities of the unit.

## Rank Structure
We use the following ranks within LANCS. The promotion policies and guidelines are below - this section is purely to show what ranks we use and how they are configured:

### Kingsman (Kgm.) and Lance Corporal (LCpl.)
These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are not in leadership positions. Rising through these ranks is mostly a matter of time in grade with a small amount of training. Lance Corporals may be called upon to act as Section 2ICs, should it be decided so by the senior leadership.

### Corporal (Cpl.) through to Regimental Sergeant Major (WO1 RSM.)**
These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are in leadership positions ( fireteam leaders through to platoon sergeants ). Rising through these ranks requires a not insignificant time commitment as well as training requirements. Members who progress beyond these ranks join the Officer Corps.

### 2nd Lieutenant (2Lt.) through to Major (Maj.)
These ranks are available to officers in the unit. These require a significant period of time spent in the NCO or WO ranks as well as additional leadership and tactical training programs. The number of officers in the unit is limited so these ranks are also subject to competitive application.


## Promotion Policy
Promotions are issued after the Unit Training Excercises and/ore Unit Operations.

Promotions should be handed out in abstentia in the event that a member is not in attendance of a given event.

Each week senior NCOs and Junior officers will prepare for the Unit Commander a summary of all eligible promotions within the unit and will provide notification to the direct chain of command that the member is promotable. Objections to promotion should be raised back through the relevant chain of command within 48 hours of original notification at which time the Unit Commander has the final say on whether the member will promote.

Promotion eligibility is determined on the following criteria:

### Time in Service
Each rank has an allocated time in service requirement which must be met to become eligible for promotion.

### Training Requirements or Demonstrated Capability
Some ranks will require the completion of some training modules or the demonstration of certain capabilities. These will naturally be built up over the course of a member's time in the unit however leadership should constantly evaluate which training programs will offer the best progression opportunities to their element.

For example a fire team leader may organise an medical training for his team as he knows several of his fireteam members have aspirations to become Platoon Medics. As he is aware of this intent he would schedule this training to help them reach their goals within the unit.

### Interview when moving corps
When moving from one set of ranks to another - such as Kingsman to Lance Corporal or Sergeant Major to 2nd Lieutenant - the member will be subject to an interview by members of the outbound rank structure. For example an NCO promoting to officer will be subject to an interview by at least two members of the officer corps. Both members of the interview panel have a veto on the final decision of the candidate. The two officers should be selected by the Unit Commander in order to provide a fair and unbiased consideration of the candidate.

### Rank Requirements
Each rank requires all of the eligibility requirements of the rank before it. For example if Lance Corporal requires the basic introductory program all subsequent ranks in the unit also require the completion of this program.
