Ranks and Promotions
======================

The 1st Rapid Response Force operates on a system of ranks which are directly tied to the position that the member holds and their seniority within the group. They can be broadly viewed as a representation of time spent in the group and whilst we expected to be respected with respect to decisions in the unit both in and out of combat they do not confer any form of direct seniority in other contexts such as other games or in general conversation.

This runs contrary to some other units courtesies policies that require officers be addressed accordingly at all times which is **NOT** the case in the 1st RRF. Rank should be a measure of time spent in the unit and the level in the chain of command in reference to the formal activities of the unit.

Rank Structure
---------------

We use the following ranks within the 1RRF. The promotion policies and guidelines are below - this section is purely to show what ranks we use and how they are configured:

**PV1 through to SPC**

These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are not in leadership positions. Rising through these ranks is mostly a matter of time in grade with a small amount of training.

**CPL through to SFC**

These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are in leadership positions ( fireteam leaders through to platoon sergeants ). Rising through these ranks requires a not insignificant time commitment as well as training requirements.

**SFC through to SGM**

These ranks are available solely to members of the special forces ODA teams. Normally a SFC would promote into the officer corps however members of the SF teams will instead progress through further NCO ranks and will not move to officer ranks.

**WOC through to CW2**

These ranks are available to members of the aviation detachment and are used for non leadership roles such as copilots, crew members or ground support.

**CW3 through to CW5**

These ranks are available to members of the aviation detachment in leadership roles such as pilots or squadron commanders.

**2LT through to MAJ**

These ranks are available to officers in both the infantry and aviation. These require a significant period of time spent in the NCO or WO ranks as well as additional leadership and tactical training programs. The number of officers in the unit is limited so these ranks are also subject to competative application.

Promotion Policy
-----------------

Promotions are issued weekly after the weekly Unit Training Excercise.

Promotions should be handed out in abstentia in the event that a member is not in attendance of a given training event.

Each week S1 will prepare for the Unit Commander a summary of all eligible promotions within the unit and will provide notification to the direct chain of command that the member is promotable. Objections to promotion should be raised back through the relevant chain of command within 48 hours of original notification at which time the Unit Commander has the final say on whether the member will promote.

Promotion eligibility is determined on the following criteria:

**Time in Service**

Each rank has an allocated time in service requirement which must be met to become eligible for promotion.

**Training Requirments**

Some ranks will require the completion of some qualifications. These will naturally be built up over the course of a member's time in the unit however leadership should constantly evaluate which training programs will offer the best progression opportunities to their element. 

For example a fire team leader may organise an Air Assault training for his team as he knows several of his fireteam members have aspirations to join the ODA teams. As he is aware of this intent he would schedule this training to help them reach their goals within the unit.

**Interview when moving corps**

When moving from one set of ranks to another - such as SPC to CPL or SFC to 2LT - the member will be subject to an interview by members of the outbound rank structure. For example an NCO promoting to officer will be subject to an interview by at least two members of the officer corps. Both members of the interview panel have a veto on the final decision of the candiate. The two officers should be selected by the Unit Commander in order to provide a fair and unbiased consideration of the candidate.

Ranks in the Reserves
---------------------------

Members in the reserves are subject to the same set of promotion and rank requirements as active duty members. No penalty nor benefit is imposed on members within the reserve corps.
