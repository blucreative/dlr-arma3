Game Environment
=================

The 1st RRF uses dedicated ARMA III servers that are maintained and operated by the S3 Operations department.

Any member can use the servers including for their own missions however these missions must be open to all members of the community.

Modpack and server updates will normally be performed on a Tuesday however hotfixes will be applied throughout the week.

The servers restart at 0800UTC each day to prevent memory leaks and overflows.

Any member of the group can take the admin slot however they must yield the slot if asked by a higher ranking member.

Automated Server Configuration
===============================

Servers are automatically configured to run their respective maps and will apply our respective ACE and ACRE configurations to any map that is loaded.

It is not necessary to place ACE or ACRE modules on the map itself.
