# Unit Structure
The Duke of Lancaster Regiment follows a Regimental structure roughly modelled around a standard British Army Infantry Regiment. As we are still new, this is currently focused on a single platoon.

## High Level Overview
At a high level the Unit consists of a Regimental Headquarters housing the Unit Commander and Unit Second-in-command (2IC) - the two highest ranking officials in the unit.

Beneath Regimental HQ the unit is divided into combat units which are on of a platoon size infantry elements. The exact number of platoons varies as the size of the unit fluctuates however we aim to maintain at least the following as a minimum deployment capability:

- 1 Fully Staffed Infantry Platoon

Each of these combat units has an Officer In Charge ( typically something between a Lieutenant and Captain depending on the size and seniority of the formation ) as well as an NCO or Warrant Officer in charge who acts as a second in command. Units at this level are independently responsible for maintaining their own combat readiness including rostering, promotion, training and discipline.

The general formations are outlined below with more detailed operational information available in the relevant subsections of the field manual for each element.

## An Infantry Platoon
Infantry Platoons are formed of three Sections of eight to fourteen men and a command element. Each platoon maintains its own medical, engineering and radio capabilities within the command element and is responsible for maintaining these capabilities within the platoon.

The command element of an infantry platoon is composed of a Platoon Commander (Plt IC), a Platoon Sergeant (Plt Sgt), a Radio Operator (Rad Op), and a Platoon Medic (Plt Med). Whilst not fulfilling their specialist roles the Radio Operator and Medic operate as a Security Detail for the Platoon Commander.

Below the Platoon Command unit are three infantry Sections consisting of one Section Commander, a Section 2IC and six to twelve infantry personnel. Infantry personnel can receive training in a diverse array of specialist abilities and will carry the special equipment required to fulfill their assigned role such as a grenade launcher, Squad Automatic Weapon or medical supplies. Section Commanders are responsible for training the members of their squad from basic training all the way through to NCO training.
