# Training Modules
Training in LANCS is split into Modules which are awarded upon completion of the requisite training goals.

Below you will find a list of each module that the unit offers.
Within each module the criteria are established alongside the provided access or equipment that the course unlocks upon completion.

## Training Process
To achieve a training goal you must be qualified as complete and compliant with published standard of the module by a member of the LANCS training/recruitment team.

Once the qualifying member believes the goal has been reasonably established he should submit a summary Module Completion Notice in Discord which will notify senior leadership of the accreditation of the trained individual.

Training modules **must be witnessed** and cannot be taken on candidate's implied or stated merit.

Training modules must be completed in an official training environment and cannot be awarded for actions taken during operations.

Training modules can however be awarded outside of official Unit Training Excercises.

Senior Leadership members will process the training module goals and, upon module completion, grant the award of any completed modules to the awarded member.
