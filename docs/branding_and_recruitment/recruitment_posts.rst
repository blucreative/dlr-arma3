Recruitment Postings and Guidelines
====================================

This covers passive recruitment posts on forums. Please find attached to each post the guidelines of the relevant forums so that we can remain compliant with their rules.

Steam
-----

DO NOT POST MULTIPLE TIMES!

As a unit we should have one thread on the site that is regularly updated with information via new replies - additionaly we should encourage at least two members a week to post their review of our group on this thread to give potential members insight into what we are truly like. This has an added benefit of regularly surfacing us to the top of the list.

BI Forums
----------

DO NOT POST MULTIPLE TIMES!

Bohemia have strict rules for their forums:

1. Do not post more often than once every two weeks. Command Staff will issue a fortnightly newsletter that should be relayed to all channels and should be the only thing posted to the BI thread to avoid violating the rules.

2. Do not lead discussions in the thread replies

3. Do not attempt to comment on other units in a BI Forums recruitment post!

BI Squad Page
-------------

BI Squads system is a bit different. It is maintained by command staff and features both our short and long form posts.

It has no interaction and so serves only as a static gateway through to our website.

ARMA Clans
----------

ARMA clans requires a system of votes. We will post our Long and Short form ads there and prompt members to vote every day.

This should help to gain maximum traffic.

  1st Rapid Response Force
  ------------------------

  The 1st Rapid Response Force is an International Military Simulation Unit dedicated to a high level of tactical simulation. We are a multi disciplinary unit with over 30 MOSs backed up by 35 training program all custom made by our members. We have a stable leadership element with three years under their belt and have built a large number of custom systems to make our unique playstyle possible. Our unit has recently launched and we are looking to grow to 160 players - get in early to be part of our future!

  1st Rapid Response Force
  ------------------------

  The 1st Rapid Response Force is an International Military Simulation unit dedicated to a high level of tactical simulation. As a Unit we intentionally choose not to base ourselves on a real life unit so that we can use a structure that is based on the real world but merges officers and NCOs to reduce redundancy.

  We are a newly launched unit that has been in development for eight months so that we could get our systems perfectly established for the type of experience we want to create.

  Here are just some of the examples of what defines us:

  **Strong Foundations**

    Spending eight months developing a unit comes with some advantages - we have used our over three years of experiencing running MILSIM groups to design a group that will allow us to reach a great level of military simulation without suffering a unit collapse because of boredom and paperwork.

    We decided to close down our old unit which had more than 140 active players so that we could dedicated ourselves to building a robust MILSIM group that would stand the test of time.

    The 1st RRF is designed to grow to 160 people, which is in our experience the largest active group that we can maintain at our desired level of quality.

  **Rigourous Training**

    As a unit we have over 30 MOS codes backed up with more than 35 training programs which combined total over 700 A4 pages of written training content.

    All of our training programs are written by people with real life experience but have been adapted to our specific ARMA environment. This is a step change to the regular "Modified Field Manual" approach of some units as it means we are only training useful and applicable information.

    The 1st RRF is an environment where anyone can fulfill their ambitions of leadership at any level in confidence that they will receive the highest quality training necessary to perform their function in a correct and standardized way.

    We don't believe in making it up as we go along and are religious in our dedication to standards and interoperability.

  **Deployments**

    We don't believe in the weekly operation concept that many units use. It is brittle and does not work well for international communities.

    Instead we use a 5 week deployment cycle in our unique deployment battlespace. Elements in the RRF operate on independant deployment cycles with 1 week of training, 3 weeks of operations ( scheduled on a per element basis working around availability ) and 1 week of off time so that members are free to enjoy other games.

    This system would not work if not for our dedicated team of 57As who manage and run the deployment environment to ensure it is providing a high quality MILSIM experience and our unique Fusion system that provides high performance persistence above and beyond other persistence system.

    Fusion is fully integrated into ACE and TFR so that all aspects of the player are persisted including medical states and ammunition loads to add a genuine need and challenge to our logistics elements.

  **A Wide Variety of Elements**

    The 1st RRF is home to a wide variety of element types including infantry ( Airborne, Air Assault, Amphibious, Light and Mechanized Infantry ), Aviation ( Fixed and Rotary Wing ), Logistics ( Air Traffic Control and Logistical Supply Teams ), Armoured ( Bradley and Paladin crews )  and Leadership Elements.

    Each Element has a custom training program and mission set but is equally useful in the battlespace. We do not have any element for the sake of having them and each is essential to our succesful operation in the deployment environment. This is due to our "No Magic" policy meaning that we do not use teleports or arsenal's in the deployment space. If a member dies or a unit runs low on supplies - a real team will need to make the supply run or reinsert that individual.

  **Friendly and Mature Community**

    We pride ourselves on having an open and welcoming community.

    We only allow 18+ members to become uniformed members of our group but younger players can still join our public servers in order to learn and experience with us.

    Unit dramas are a constant threat that can be extremely destabilizing to a unit; To prevent this we operate with a high level of transparency as well as defining our stance on all actions in our Discipline Guidelines. Our command staff do not descriminate and we are publicly commited to equal rules and punishments regardless of rank or position.

    We release all of our materials and tools publicly so that we are held accountable by our community. We are driven to be the best not because of proprietary tools but because of our community.
