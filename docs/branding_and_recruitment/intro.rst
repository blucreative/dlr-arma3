Introduction to Branding and Recruitment
==========================================

The 1st RRF strongly believes a united team effort is required for us to succeed.

A crucial part of this team effort is making sure that everyone is able to easily talk about the things they love in this unit through a command and clear format.

To help aide this we have created guidelines for members to use when interacting with public channels. This includes posting images, talking about that cool operation you were in or interacting with viewers on a twitch stream. It is especially important for recruitment where you will act as the first point of contact for new recruits.
