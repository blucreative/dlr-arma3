# Infantry Formations and Manoeuvres
Formations and Movement techniques are vitally important parts of operating in the infantry. They are a lot more valuable than just to look pretty as they dictate the level of security and speed with which the element can move.

Formations apply all the way up to the platoon level and sometime higher, however each individual element leader is responsible for their elements positions. Platoon Leaders position Sections, Section Commanders position Fire Team Leaders and Fire Team Leaders position Fire Team members.

There are more formations than those listed in this training program. These will be explained and demonstrated as and when they are required.

## Movement in a Section or Fireteam
Fire teams will always stay within audible and visual range of each other. All members of the team should be able to see and hear the fire team leader at all times. S

When moving, all members of a fire team should mirror the stance of the fire team leader unless instructed otherwise.

Teams may move at a variety of different speeds depending on the threat level and timeline of objectives.

There are five speeds of movement that you will encounter:

* Walking/Patrolling
* Combat Pace
* Combat Pace with Weapon Lowered
* Jog with Weapon Holstered
* Sprinting

During your Basic Training, your instructor will demonstrate how to move at these paces and switch between them.

Whilst moving there is a constant compromise between two aspects: Speed and Security. When moving as a fire team you will normally not be in a position to decide a formation, but it is important to understand regardless.

> **Note**:
Speed: The speed at which the element is able to cover distance\\
Security: The ability that the element has to detect and respond to contact

## Formations for Sections/Fireteams

### Single File

![Single File](~/img/singlefile.png)

Ideal for moving along hedge lines, walls and other linear features. This formation provides the section commander with good control. It is easy to maintain both during the day and at night. Gives good arcs of fire to the flanks, but is vulnerable to attack from the front or rear.

### Staggered File

![Staggered File](~/img/staggered.png)

Used mainly for moving along road and tracks. Similar characteristics to single file, although while it gives slightly better firepower to the front and rear there is a danger of members of the section being caught in other section members fire during an attack from the flanks. As such, it is commonly recommended that only one half of the formation return fire during contact, depending on the side enemy fire is coming from.

### Arrowhead

![Arrowhead](~/img/arrowhead.png)

Arrowhead is the most commonly used formation during field manoeuvres. This formation is ideal for crossing large open areas such as fields and desert. It provides excellent firepower to the front and 50% of the sections firepower to either flank. It can, however, be difficult to maintain and control, especially at night.

### Extended Line

![Extended Line](~/img/extended.png)

Extended Line is used mainly when preparing for an assault on an enemy position as it leads itself to easy movement into a bounding assault. It is also useful when searching an area for equipment or injured personnel. It is, however, difficult to maintain, especially when moving at speed.

### Diamond

![Diamond](~/img/diamond.png)

This formation, used on rare occasions, is used in much the same way as arrowhead. It is especially useful in place of arrowhead at night and is much easier to control and maintain. It does, however, provide less firepower to the front than arrowhead.

### Half Attack

![Half Attack](~/img/halfattack.png)

Half attack is a formation that is often used in place of Staggered File. It works in much the same way as the former, although it is especially useful when you are expecting contact from either flank. As the two fireteams are in separate bricks rather than simply offset, a bounding attack or withdrawal can begin without first having to organise the section into an extended line, saving valuable time when under fire.
