The Infantry Squad and Fireteam
=====================================

The structures that the RRF group infantry into are based on those found in real militaries.

.. note::

  An Element is defined as a structure that is made of people and sub elements with a defined leader.

From smallest to largest, these structures are:

**The Fireteam**

  A Fireteam is the smallest element size in the RRF.

  A fireteam consists of four members and a Team Leader for a total of five personnel.

  Fire teams act within a squad, meaning that the squad leader will control their macroscopic objectives and positioning. A Team Leader is therefore responsible for controlling the micro level tactics of the fireteam such as exact positioning ( which tree to hide behind ), ensuring formation, leading MOUT breaches and managing ammunition and medical levels.

  An infantry Fireteam in the RRF is typically constructed of the following roles:

  **Team Leaders:**

    Responsible for leading the fireteam.

    Fire team leaders are trained in radio procedures and will communicate with the squad leader so they can accomplish the mission in line with the squad leader's intent.

    The leader of the fire team is also in charge of sending reports about his teams status to the squad leader.

  **Grenadiers:**

    Grenadiers are regular rifleman armed with under barrel grenade launchers to provide explosive suppression of the enemy using the 40mm grenade.

    Grenadiers will also carry an elevated number of both lethal and non lethal grenades to assist the mission objective.

  **Automatic Rifleman:**

    Automatic Rifleman are armed with the M249 light machine gun to provide supressing fire using controlled bursts of high volume firepower.

    This member of the team will often carry a reduced equipment load relative to the rest of his team to compensate for the additional weight of his weapon and ammunition.

  **Specialist Role:**

    Specialists are trained in a specific ability - such as Designated Marksman or Demolitions Specialists. The exact role will vary based on the squad and its position in the unit but generally denotes a specialized loadout and possibly additional training.

    Every fireteam has one specialist and unit command will assign specialists to a team based on perceived synergy and value.

**The Squad**

  A Squad is the most common element of movement in the RRF and the smallest assignable element in the unit ( A fireteam cannot be independantly tasked by command ).

  Squads are made up of two fireteams and a squad leader for a total of 11 personnel. The two fire teams in the squad will have different specialists which will in turn determine the capability of that squad.

  **The Squad Leader**

    A Squad Leader is responsible for receiving an intent from command and implementing that using the two fire teams under his command.

    He is also responsible for receiving information from the fire team leaders below him and effectively reporting that information back up to command.

    A squad leader is always a SGT or higher, normally a SSG and is an experienced member of the unit who is able to train and lead his squad in line with RRF doctrine.

    Finally, Squad Leaders serve as points of contact and advice for the troops below them helping them to advance and prosper in the RRF.

**The Platoon**

  A platoon is a grouping of squads under the command of an officer and in most cases accompanied by a 68W Medic.

  The number of squads in a platoon varies from two to four depending on which formation of the infantry you are in.

  A Platoon is the mechanism by which multiple squads work together and is the backbone of large scale operations in the RRF.

  Platoons are also the smallest element that we will mobilise to an AOR meaning that all elements in a Platoon will undergo TDY and deployment at the same time.

  To become an officer and lead a platoon is one of the most prestigious positions in the RRF and requires a large percentage of our training programs to have been completed as well as having demonstrated great leadership and problem solving qualities.
