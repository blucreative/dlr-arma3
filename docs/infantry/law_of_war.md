# Laws of War
The Duke of Lancaster Regiment is compliant with all military discipline treaties that the British military is compliant with. In summary, these are as follows:
- Articles of War
- Armed Forces Act 2006
- 1949 The Geneva Convention
- The Hague Rules
- 1977 Additional Protocols
- European Convention on Human Rights

Below is the complete set of legal regulations under which we operate. Any clause of the above documents that is not summarized below does not apply to our group so as to ease the level of knowledge and time given to legal compliance. Members should generally aim to comply with the highest ethical standards whilst playing and should apply good judgement to cases which are not direct violations but would obviously pose a moral or legal problem in reality.

## Handling of Enemy Combatants

### Accepting Surrendering Personnel
Enemy combatants who willingly surrender should not be harmed and must be provided with security and a timely evacuation as early as safe and reasonable to do so. Enemy personnel who are injured and surrender should be provided with medical attention if it is safe for the receiving unit to do so.

A surrendering Prisoner of War (PW) must be accepted as a surrender. It is not acceptable to decline a surrender. If a surrendering PW fails to comply with instructions necessary for his safe inward processing such as continuing to move when told not to or by drawing a weapon, then the receiving force may take action to defend itself.

Enemy personnel who are incapacitated should be detained, processed as PWs and provided with aid.

The location of any PW must be reported in a timely manner to the Chain of Command and all PWs must be monitored by command to ensure their safe passage.

### Humane Treatment of PWs
All prisoners, regardless of whether they belong to a flagged military or not, should be treated humanely. This right is universal and must not be infringed.

Humane treatment constitutes the following:

* No Degrading or Humiliating treatment. Examples include the removal of clothing and deprivation of food or resources.
* Protected from Violence or Intimidation
* Shielded from insults, public curiosity or verbal degradation. In particular PWs should not be displayed to local populace or forces if possible to prevent later reprisal.
* No reprisals are permitted for actions that the PW or his force committed prior to being detained

### Physical and Mental Torture
Prisoners must not be subjected to physical or mental torture.
This includes mock executions and the deprivation of food, water or medical aid.

### Equal Treatment
PWs must not be discriminated against based on gender, religion, ethnicity or other culture distinctions. Affordances should be made to facilitate the religious practise of the PW.

### Failure to comply
Any failure to comply with the regulations described above will be dealt with according to the unit disciplinary policy and may result in Discharge with Disgrace from the unit.
