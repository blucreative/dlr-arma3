# Infantry Battle Drills
Battle Drills are practiced responses to a given situation that represent the ideal mechanism for the response.

They define our normal response to situations in ideal conditions, however, your Section Commander will have received training on their use and implementation. As such they tend to fall more as guidelines that are adapted to the situation in the field. You should be prepared for this by having the best possible knowledge of these drills so that you are able to understand how to modify and implement them.

> **note**: Many Battle Drills are not taught directly at the Basic Training level. You Squad Leader will train you in more Battle Drills depending on your element's role and his insight into your squad.

## Six Section Battle Drills
Primarily, LANCS forces base their battle drills on the Six Section Battle Drills used by the British Military, denoted by the acronym PRESAR:
- Prep for battle
- Reaction to Effective Enemy Fire
- Enemy location
- Suppressing the Enemy
- Attack
- Reorg

### Prep for Battle
The initial phase allows the whole section to get ready for subsequent operations, with all the necessary equipment in a suitable condition. Again, this is denoted using the acronym PAWPERSO.
- Protection - all round defence
- Ammunition - loaded in magazines, reserve held with the 2IC.
- Weapons - Pulled through and oiled (in-game this step is skipped as there is no game mechanic for it)
- Personal Camouflage - Appropriate to the environment, work in pairs.
- Equipment - All equipment is good condition and suitable for the briefed objective.
- Radios - correct frequencies and a radio check carried out.
- Special Equipment - e.g. wire cutters, entry charges, AT, AA etc.
- Orders - Model built, Section Commander to brief section on next phase.

### Reaction to Effective Enemy Fire
Effective enemy fire consists of rounds landing around your feet, or causing direct casualties. A few shots sailing over your head do not count as EEF. When you do come under EEF, the process is as follows:
- Dash - sprint a few yards forward in a zig-zag type pattern
- Down - drop to the prone position
- Crawl - one down, crawl to a position of relative cover, or at least move away from the position you went prone to prevent the enemy having a fix on your exact location.
- Observe - Locate enemy positions
- Sights - Aim at the Enemy
- Fire - Return fire.

### Enemy location
Locating the enemy is vital. "Has anybody seen the enemy?" If you can see the enemy give GRIT:
- Group - who in your section will fire back
- Range - In metres, or if in a dire situation, use near, medium, long range to give a rough estimation.
- Indication - give an obvious and unique description of enemy location
- Type of fire to be returned

An example of GRIT would be, "Charlie team, 200m, white building with blue shutters at bearing 155, RAPID FIRE!" and should be given as CLAP:
- Clear
- Loud
- As an order
- Pauses

### Suppressing the Enemy
The simplest of the section battle drills. This means putting down enough rounds to keep the enemies heads down and allows a fireteam the freedom to manoeuvre.

### Attack
The attack is split into three phases:
- Approach
- Assault
- Fight through
Left or right flanking, or straight up the middle with bags of smoke. The Section Commander and 2IC control the section to make best use of available cover.

### Reorganisation
After "Position Clear!" or "Reorg!" has been called, the whole Section are to move to a position 20-30m from the cleared enemy position.
Break Contact Rear

## Platoon Attacks
At a Platoon level the same battle drills are used except entire sections are used instead of fireteams. In this effect a platoon attack drill might work like this:

1. The first section takes contact, becomes decisively engaged and communicates the contact information whilst suppressing the target
2. The second section moves to flank and push through the contact
3. The third section provides rear cover and/or operates as a QRF should Section 2 become overwhelmed.
3. Second section assault and move to the line of advance on the objective.
4. First section move up and push to the line of advance on the objective.
5. All Sections reorg.

## Additional Battle Drills
Once you are assigned to a Section your Section IC will introduce you to more task specific drills during trainings. This will help your squad to become more effective at handling situations that are commonly encountered in your particular discipline.
