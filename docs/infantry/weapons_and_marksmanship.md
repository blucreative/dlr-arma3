# Weapons and Marksmanship
This manual covers the issue, safe employment and tactical techniques associated with infantry weapon employment. This manual does not cover speciality weapon systems such as Automatic Rifles, Grenade Launchers or Designated Marksman Rifles.

## Weapon Safety
All weapons in the Duke of Lancaster Regiment come with a safety mechanism which should be engaged when outside of a combat area or live fire range. By default the safety is toggled by pressing ``Ctrl + ` `` and will prevent the weapon from firing.

Friendly fire instances are treated extremely seriously under the disciplinary policy so it is important that members maintain the rules of weapon safety when operating in the battlespace.

## The Rules of Weapon Handling
1. Do not point your weapon at anything you do not intend to kill. The weapon should remain in the rest position, or slung/holstered, when not in use.
2. In safe areas where security is maintained, magazines should be removed from the weapon system or on supporting weapons the safety engaged. It is also advisable to sling/holster your weapon in these areas.
3. Do not discharge your weapon for any reason other than combat engagement ( Celebration Shots and Direction Indicating Shots risk lives and waste ammunition ). Negligent discharge, or accidental firing of a weapon may result in weapon privileges being revoked until such time as weapon training is redone.

## Issued Weapons
In LANCS infantry are not permitted to modify their rifle beyond the standard loadout. During operations, Unit Leadership may permit the use of non-standard equipment and this will be explained during the operation briefing.

## Ammunition Management
Standard ammunition issue for a LANCS rifleman is 1 magazine in the weapon, 6 in the vest and 3 in the rucksack.

Partial magazines should be retained and can be repacked using the ACE interaction menu when there is a lull in combat that provides sufficient time and security to do so.

All issued infantry weapon system are magazine cross compatible with the exception of the 7.62 DMR which uses it's own magazines. As such Section ICs will attempt to balance ammunition between different members of the section to maintain a uniform quantity of ammo within the team.

| :warning: **Warning**: LANCS infantry should not pickup enemy weapons. In the event that an element is rendered entirely black on ammunition command has the option to modify the ROE to allow the use of enemy weapons. |

## Types of Fire
Type of Fire are the different paces and accuracy of fire that can be employed.

### Deliberate Fire
This is the most basic and intuitive type of fire. It involves accurately aiming at and hitting the target - with each shot being aimed and placed.

Deliberate fire is typically used when the enemy is exposed and can be acquired and engaged precisely. Examples would be ambushing an enemy squad in the open or engaging a particular target inside a designated building.

### Burst Fire
Burst fire is used to engage a specific area instead of a specific target. This can be used to engage enemy units that are obscured, massed or beyond the effective range of the element's point fire capability, to allow a fire team to move in relative safety.

During covering fire the shooters will identify areas that they know or suspect the enemy will be and focus on providing concentrated volumes of fire as opposed to well placed accuracy.

Covering fire involves firing at a higher rate than Controlled fire but at a significantly lower rate than Rapid fire.

###  Rapid Fire
Rapid fire involves placing a large volume of rounds on the enemy position so that they are unable to return effective fire.

In order for rapid fire to be effective against an enemy the enemy must believe they are in danger of being hit by the rapid fire. This means that although the pace of fire is fast the fire must remain within a close vicinity to the enemy position so as to keep them pinned.

Rapid fire makes heavy use of ammunition and will normally be drawn down to a controlled rate of fire to conserve ammunition once fire superiority has been established.

## Weapon Malfunctions
During use weapons will become hot which increases the possibility of a weapon jam occurring.

To clear a weapon jam open the ACE interaction menu and select "Clear Jam" under the Equipment options.
