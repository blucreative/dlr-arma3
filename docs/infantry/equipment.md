# Weapon and Equipment List
The intent of our equipment and weapons loadout is to allow flexibility for member choices while maintaining a realistic standardization.  The following guidance provides detail on the approved infantry loadouts.  Any variation not included in this guidance is unauthorized unless cleared by the chain of command, who reserve the right to add to and remove from the loadouts on a mission specific basis.

> **Danger**: Any member with unauthorized weapons or equipment during an official event will be subject to disciplinary action.

## Weapons

### Primary Weapons
The current standard issue rifle of LANCS is the L85A2 (SA80) 5.56mm associated with the 3CB-BAF weapon pack. Platoon, Section and Fireteam Leaders, as well as rifleman with the grenadier proficiency are permitted to use underslung grenade launchers. The addition of UGL's to a unit loadout will be at the whim of the Commanding Officer for the operation.

The current standard issue automatic rifle of LANCS is the L7A2 7.62x51mm general purpose machine gun (GPMG) associated with the 3CB-BAF weapon pack. On some occasions, this may be switched out for the L108 Minimi Light Machine Gun.

Designated Marksman are issued the L129 7.62Ã—51mm sharpshooter rifle.

Suppressors will be handed out as and when they are specifically needed. There is no need to carry a suppressor as part of a standard loadout.  The same rules apply to other weapon attachments such as Torches and Laser sights.  Other weapon attachments such as foregrips are permitted.

Optics are standardised depending on the rifle being used:
- L85 A2 - Elcan Lightweight Day Sight (LDS)
- L7A2 GPMG - Irons
- L108 Minimi - Elcan Lightweight Day Sight (LDS)
- L129A1 - Trijicon ACOG TA648RMR-308 Marksman Scope

It is expected that every soldier be able to use their weapon using iron sights only. This will be included as part of basic training.

### Secondary Weapons
LANCS only uses the L131A1 General Service Pistol (Glock 17). No optics are authorized for use with side arms.

### Launchers
LANCS will deploy appropriate anti-tank, or anti-air, weapons based on threat and environment.  The chain of command will authorize use as needed.  No member is authorized to carry a launcher as part of their standard loadout.
