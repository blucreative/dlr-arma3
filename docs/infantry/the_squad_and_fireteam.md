# The Infantry Section and Fireteam
The structures that the Duke of Lancaster Regiment are organised into are based on those found in British Army Infantry Regiments.

From largest to smallest, these structures are:

## The Platoon
In the British Army, a rifle platoon from an infantry company consists of three sections of eight men, plus a signaller (radio operator), a platoon sergeant (a sergeant), the platoon commander (either a second lieutenant or lieutenant) and, on rare occasions, a mortar man operating a light mortar.

Each section is commanded by a Corporal , with a Lance Corporal as second-in-command and six riflemen divided into two four-man fireteams. Support weapons platoons (such as mortar or anti-tank platoons) are generally larger and are commanded by a Captain with a Colour Sergeant or WO2 as 2IC.

A Platoon is the mechanism by which multiple squads work together and is the backbone of large scale operations in LANCS.

To become an officer and lead a platoon is one of the most prestigious positions in LANCS and requires a large percentage of our training programs to have been completed as well as having demonstrated great leadership and problem solving qualities.

## The Section
A Section is the most common element of movement in LANCS and the smallest assignable element in the unit (A fireteam cannot be independently tasked by command). The British section consists of eight soldiers, which under normal circumstances are divided into a Charlie and Delta fireteam.

The current British infantry section is as follows:
- Corporal (Charlie team commander and overall section commander) armed with an L85 5.56mm rifle
- Lance Corporal (Delta team commander and Section 2IC) armed with an L85 5.56mm rifle
- Four Riflemen armed with L85 5.56mm rifles
- Gunner armed with an L7A2 7.62x51mm general purpose machine gun, or in some cases the L108 Minimi Light Machine Gun (at the section commander's discretion, the gunner can be re-rolled as an additional rifleman with an L85 5.56mm rifle if needed).
- Designated marksman armed with an L129 7.62Ã—51mm sharpshooter rifle

### The Section Commander (IC)
A Section Commander is responsible for receiving an intent from command and implementing that using the two fire teams under his command. He/she is also responsible for receiving information from the fire team leaders below him and effectively reporting that information back up to command.

A Section IC is always a Cpl. or higher, and is an experienced member of the unit who is able to train and lead his squad in line with LANCS doctrine.

Finally, Section ICs serve as points of contact and advice for the troops below them helping them to advance and prosper in LANCS.

## The Fireteam
A Fireteam is the smallest element size in LANCS.

During combat, and infantry section is usually split in half to form fireteams. These are usually described as Charlie Fireteam and Delta Fireteam for the sake of quick, reactionary commands.
Fire teams act within a Section, meaning that the Section IC will control their macroscopic objectives and positioning. A Fire Team Leader is therefore responsible for controlling the micro level tactics of the fireteam such as exact positioning ( which tree to hide behind ), ensuring formation, leading OBUA breaches and managing ammunition and medical levels.

An infantry Fireteam in LANCS is typically broken down as follows:
- Team Leader: Corporal (IC) - Charlie or Lance Corporal (2IC) - Delta
- 2x Riflemen
- Specialist (Auto Rifleman - Delta, Designated Marksman - Charlie)

Every fireteam has one specialist and unit command will assign different specialists to a team based on perceived synergy and value to the current objective.
