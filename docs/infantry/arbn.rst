AARBN Manual
=================

An Airborne insertion is a parachute jump, normally from a fixed wing aircraft but sometimes from helicopters for training purposes.

Airborne jumps are complex combined arms maneouvers and follow a highly structured procedure.

Boarding the Aircraft
-------------------------------------------------

When you have equipped your parachute and formed into two ranks, the Aviation Logistics Specialist and Loadmaster will pass control to the jump master.  From this point on, he is in charge of all actions until you leave the aircraft.  The logistics team will clear each file to approach the aircraft in series to prevent glitches that occur during simultaenous boarding. The jump master will instruct you to take a knee, then he will coordinate with the aircraft crew for loading procedures.

When the aircraft crew indicates it is clear to load, the jump master will instruct you to stand up and move past him up the ramp and into the aircraft.  You will use your scroll wheel while looking at the inside of the side doors to load as a passenger.  Do not worry if you are sitting on the wrong side when you load; you will be given instruction during the pre-jump phase on assuming the appropriate side for the jump.

Once all personnel are loaded, the jump master will then give the all clear to the loadmaster and they will begin taxi, take off and movement.  Upon approaching the Drop Zone, at which time a call will be sent to the jumpmaster, you will remain silent on both verbal and radio communications.  This is to ensure that the jump master can communicate with the aircraft crew and to prevent confusion.

At this point Pre Jump procedures are undertaken.


Pre-Jump Sequence
-------------------

The Pre Jump Sequence is the hardest part of the Airborne training program and represents the most complex and important part of the jump both technically and from a simulation standpoint.

.. warning::

  Incorrect application of these techniques can cause death to yourself or others as well as possible damage to the aircraft.

  Pay attention to instructions given by the Jump Master and Aircraft crew at all times.

Five Minutes Out
~~~~~~~~~~

When the aircraft is 5 minutes out from the DZ, the jump master will stand up and move to his position at the rear of the aircraft.

The Jump Master will call out “5 minutes” and all jumpers will respond back to him with a shout of “5 minutes”.

At this time the Jump Master will open the doors and instruct the jumpers to stand up by side. Pay attention to the side called and do not stand up until your side is called to prevent over crowding in the jump area.

.. note::

  To stand up you should use the scroll wheel option "Move Inside".

  **DO NOT USE THE VANILLA EJECT OR GET OUT BUTTON**

**Equipment Checks**

Once you have stood up you should line up in a file on your assigned side without proceeding past the danger area of the door denoted by a red line. Any area beyond the red line is considered unsafe and you may fall out of the aircraft past this point.

Once lined up and facing the front of the aircraft - i.e away from the jump exit - the Jump Master will call "Check Equipment".

Starting at the rear you should check the equipment of the jumper behind you in the stack before turning around and allowing the next jumper to inspect your gear.

.. note::

  When checking for equpment you are looking for the following things:

  * Does the Jumper have a parachute?
  * Is the parachute attached to the rear of the jumper and not the front?
  * Does the Jumper have Goggles on?
  * Does the Jumper have a helmet on?

Once this process is complete, all jumpers will be aligned in files on either side facing toward the exit doors at the rear of the aircraft. The last man in the file - i.e the one closest the door - should call to the Jump Master that their side is set.

**The equipment check process should take no more than 3 minutes form standing up to being jump ready for a full insertion of 25 people**

Approaching the DZ
~~~~~~~~~~

After the equipment checks, the jump master will coordinate with the crew for an eta to the drop zone. The Jump Master will relay this information to the jumpers and all jumpers should repeat back the information to the Jump Master.

When the aircraft is one minute out, the jump master will tell the first jumpers to “stand in the door”. They will move one step beyond the red line, turn and face the door. Jumpers should take care not to move into the door itself to prevent a premature exit.

All other jumpers will move forward and close up the space so that the next jumper is on line with the red danger indicator.

Conducting the Jump
-----------

The jump master will continue to give warnings at the 30 second and 10 second marks. You should remain focused on the door so that you do not delay the jump by missing a key or getting your alignment wrong.

The Green Light
~~~~~~~~~~

When the aircraft crew indicates green light the jump light on both doors and the ramp will move from red to green and the jump master will announce “Green light go, go, go” to the first jumper. At this time they will exit the aircraft.

Jumpers will continue to move forward to the door and exit as the jump master says “go” to them.

It is critical to the timing of the jump to continue moving toward the door and exiting when the jump master says to go. If you exit early, you risk injuring yourself and if you exit late you risk missing the drop zone, or causing others to miss the drop zone.

.. danger::
    Remember to only exit the Aircraft once you are told to do so by the jump master.

Again this is not a freefall course. You are expected to open your parachute 1-3 seconds after exiting the airframe. This also helps to prevents jumpers from colliding in the air and injuring themselves.

Once you hear “go”, walk forward and you will ejected from the aircraft.

Count to 3, then use the scroll wheel to open your parachute. You will then be able to steer yourself so you do not miss the drop zone. You will not have much time with which to navigate the parachute so you should only make minor course adjustments to avoid any obstructions such as trees or fences that may be in the DZ.

As you approach the ground, make sure to “flare” your parachute by pressing the backward movement key, or you may get injured during the landing.

.. warning::

    You should refrain from making liberal use of the forward movement key. Doing so will increase your airspeed and risks causing severe injury on impact.

.. note::

    Upon landing you may sometimes become entangled on buildings or trees. If this happens, use your ACE self interaction key to cut your parachute away allowing you to fall to the ground.

    This will incur some damage but will ultimately prevent you from dying or being stuck in a tree.

Rallying at the RP
-----------

Once you land you need to regroup at the predesignated Rally Point (RP) so that you can proceed with the rest of the operation.

Prior to the jump your leadership will have marked a primary, secondary and fallback RV for you to use. The Jump Masters will have clarified the RV points before boarding the airframes, but it is up to you to correctly navigate to the RV and make link up with your team.

.. note::
    You should get clear of the DZ as soon as possible so that the area is clear for further troop landings.

Moving away from the DZ to the RP
~~~~~~~~~~

Before moving you should take off your parachute and use the ACE key to reequip your rucksack that was previously attached to your front.

Immediately move to the rally points in order of priority. If a Rally Point is compromised or unsuitable, attempt to contact your element to notify your leader of the situation and proceed to the next LZ in the list.

If you are unable to clear the Drop Zone due to injury, enemy contact or adverse terrain seek cover and concealment if available and attempt to contact your leadership for assistance.
