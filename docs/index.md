# Welcome to the Duke of Lancaster Regiment - Field Training Manual
## About the Duke of Lancaster Regiment
The Duke of Lancaster Regiment (LANCS) is an Arma 3 MILSIM unit providing authentic MILSIM operations utilising British military tactics and equipment.

If you are interested in joining an Arma 3 unit with strong dedication to British MILSIM, please visit our website at [dlr-arma3.co.uk](http://www.dlr-arma3.co.uk).


## About the Field Training Manual
The LANCS Field Training Manual is our central repository for all our written information and documentation. It forms the central structure for policies and tactics of the unit, both inside and outside of the Arma 3 game environment. The entire manual is published at [docs.dlr-arma3.co.uk](http://docs.dlr-arma3.co.uk).

The training detailed in this manual is mostly specific to our specific game environment, but much is portable within the wider Arma 3 community.

LANCS must thank the [1st Rapid Response Force](https://documentation.1st-rrf.com/index.html), for providing the basis of this training manual and a root structure to work from.
