Communications with Ground Forces
=====================================

Terms
--------
**Initial Point - IP**
    Flexible initial starting or endpoint to allow Fixed Wing Aircraft to loiter with an area before being called in for CAS.  Usually 2000-5000m away from an active target area. Can be created at any time by the JTAC and are usually multiple IP’s within the AO. 

**Battle Position - BP**
    Flexible initial starting or ending point for Rotary Aircraft that can use the terrain to stay hidden away from enemy view.  Usually located 2000m or less. Can be multiple BP’s when the AO.

**Holding Area - HA**
    A flexible area where Rotary Aircraft can loiter until they are tasked by the JTAC or Ground commander. 

**HOT**
    Intent is to disable the target **NOT** destroy it.

**Engauge**
    Intent is to continue to attack until the target is destroyed

Airframe Check-in Procedures
--------
All Close Air Support Aircraft – will check in upon entering the operational airspace & with the current/operating JTAC(s), through the Flight Lead in the Air Command Channel:  This is to keep the JTAC(s) informed of the number of Aircraft, type & ordnance available to them.

Once the JTAC has provided the “Go Ahead/Proceed” with check in, the flight lead will relay all available CAS Capabilities to the JTAC(s)

Template
~~~~~~~~
    1. # and Type of Aircraft: (One F-15E)
    2. Position and Altitude (Grid, Marker, battle position)
    3. Ordinance (NOTE) if they are equipped with the “Default” loadout, the pilot will just state “Default”.  If they pilot has anything OTHER than default he/she will state the type and quantity of each munition. 
    4. TOS (Time on Station) – Time Available for tasking 
    5. (optional) Abort Code - Provided by Flight Lead – default is “Abort”
    6. (optional) Remarks

.. note::

  For the following communication snippet the following situation is active: Due to Major Activity in the AOR Multiple Close Air Support Airframes are operating in the AO. Flight Lead (EAGLE-1) has assumed Liaison Role to facilitate communication between JTAC Operators and Pilots until a Tasking has been requested by a JTAC operator.  Eagle-6 Has taken off from Main Base and has arrived at IP GOLD pending check in.  

Initial Check in

    - **CAS Pilot (Eagle 6)**: "EAGLE-1 (Flight Lead), EAGLE-6 (CAS Pilot)"
    - **Flight Lead (Eagle 1)**: “Six, this is One, Go Ahead”
    - **CAS Pilot**: "On Station IP GOLD, Ready for Check in"
    - **Flight Lead**: “Wait One…”
    - **Flight Lead**: “Six, One, Proceed with Check in”
    - **CAS Pilot**: "Times One, F-15E, IP GOLD, In holding pattern, at One Five Zero Zero Feet (1500), Times Two GBU-24, Times 2 AIM-9, Times 2 AIM-120, Time On Station (or Play Time) 22 Mike (Dependent on Fuel/Mission):: Say Ready for Remarks::"
    - **Flight Lead**: “Ready for Remarks”
    - **CAS Pilot**: "Heavy Cloud Cover Prevents “Danger Close”, visibility under 1 mile::Over::"

    - **CAS Pilot**: "Good Readback – Moving to ACC - Standing by for Tasking::OUT::"

EAGLE-1 (Flight Lead): Relays information from EAGLE-6 On ACC Net: (Lobby for all JTAC/Pilots Operating in the AO)

    - **Flight Lead**: “::BREAK, BREAK, BREAK:: All Joint Operators on this Net Prepare for Aircraft Check-in”
    - **(JTAC) Vengeance**: "Proceed with Check in"
    - **Flight Lead**: “EAGLE-6, F-15E, Holding pattern @ IP GOLD, Times Two GBU-24, AIM-9, AIM-120’s, TOS 20 Mike::Say Ready for Remarks::”
    - **(JTAC) Vengeance**: “Ready for Remarks”
    - **Flight Lead**: “Due 2 Cloud Cover::Danger Close Requiring Higher Authority::OVER::”
    - **(JTAC) Vengeance**: “EAGLE-6, Holding @ IP GOLD, Times Two GBU-24, AIM-9, AIM-120’s, TOS 20 Mike::Danger Close Requires GOE (General Officer Endorsement)::OVER”
    - **Flight Lead**: “Good Copy Vengeance:: One, OUT::”

Close Air Support Request
--------
There are two types of requests based on the type of aircraft. Rotary uses a 5-line reuqest while Fixed-Wing uses a 9-line.

JTAC Control Types
~~~~~~~~
    1. **Type-1** : = JTAC requires control of individual attacks and must visually acquire the aircraft and target for each attack (via optics, binoculars)
    2. **Type-2** : = JTAC is unable to acquire the target; and/or attacking aircraft, unable to acquire the mark/target prior to weapons release: (Preferred is Type II Controlled)
    3. **Type-3** : = JTAC requires the ability to provide clearance for multiple attacks within a single engagement:  JTAC is not required to visually acquire the aircraft or the target however, all targeting data must be coordinated through TOC:  JTAC maintains “ABORT” Authority.


Template
~~~~~~~~
9-Line Fixed Wing Request
    1. IP/BP: = Where the Aircraft will start their CAS Run From
    2. Heading: = Bering from IP to Target
    3. Distance: = Range from IP to Target (in Meters)
    4. Target Elevation: = Elevation of Target
    5. Target Description: = Basic or Detailed
    6. Target Location: 6 or 8 Grid Coordinates 
    7. Type mark: (N/A, Smoke, Laser, IR, Strobe)
    8. Location of Friendlies: (Cardinal Direction and Distance from Target)
    9. Egress: (Unless specific instructions…use “Pilot Discretion”
    10. Remarks (optional)

The 9 Line ends by informing the Pilot “You are cleared…” HOT or to Engauge:

5-Line Rotary Request
    1. Observer / Warning Order / Game plan
    2. Friendly Location / Mark
    3. Target Location = Grid/Visible Identifications
    4. Target Description/Marked by
    5. Remarks / Restrictions

The 5 Line ends by informing the Pilot “You are cleared…” HOT or to Engauge

.. note::

  TF 13.1 was patrolling the outskirts of Turkit where they started to receive indirect fire from the west.  After a 1hr engagement a recon element noticed a T-55 moving in from the North of TF 13.1 Position.  The JTAC Operator reminded the Team Lead of the Close-Air-Support (CAS) available to them.  The team lead provided the “GO” to disable the T-55.  Here is the Transmission from “Vengeance”, the JTAC Operator attached to TF 13.1.

A MEDEVAC is the timely movement and en route care by medical personnel of an injured, wounded, or ill patient from the battlefield to another location or medical facility.

A MEDEVAC is requested by using a modified 5-line request.
