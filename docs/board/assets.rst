Asset Ownership and Management
==========================================
Assets are defined as resources on which the 1st RRF is reliant for its operations. Primarily this references any server which the RRF uses to conduct itâ€™s operations including game, voice and web servers.

These assets must be made accessible to each member of the Board of Operations. At such a time as a member of the Board of Operations is removed or resigns from the board then they should be removed from all assets and the credentials for these assets must be cycled.
